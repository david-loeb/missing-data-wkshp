# Workshop Materials: Missing Data Handling for Policy Research and RCTs

This repo contains the source materials for a workshop I taught in May 2025. It includes the quarto document used to generate the presentation (missing_data_wkshp_slides.qmd), R code to implement the methods covered with detailed explanations (missing_data_code_and_explanations.qmd), and that same code without explanation (missing_data_code.R). You can [view the rendered slides here](https://davidloeb-missing-data-wkshp.share.connect.posit.cloud/).
